## Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of Machine Learning in which an agent learns to interact with its environment by taking actions and receiving rewards. 

## Multi-Agent RL (MARL)

Multi-Agent RL is an extension of RL in which multiple agents interact with each other and their environment simultaneously. 

## Predator-Prey Problem

The Predator Prey Problem is a classic example of MARL, in which two or more agents (the predator(s) and the prey) interact with each other and their environment in order to maximize their respective rewards.
